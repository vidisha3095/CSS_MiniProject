Certainly! Below is a suggested content for your README.txt file for the provided Python script for encrypting and decrypting images using Triple DES:

Image Encryption and Decryption Using Triple DES
This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard). Triple DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block, increasing the key length and enhancing security.

Requirements
Python 3.x cryptography library
Pillow (Python Imaging Library) for image processing

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install cryptography Pillow

GUI Elements
Image Path: Enter or browse to select the path of the image file.
Keys (Key 1, Key 2, Key 3): Enter or generate three keys required for encryption and decryption.
Generate Random Keys: Automatically generates three random keys for encryption.
Encrypt: Encrypts the selected image using Triple DES with the provided keys.
Decrypt: Decrypts the selected encrypted image using Triple DES with the provided keys.
Reset: Clears all entry fields.
Exit: Closes the application.

Notes
Ensure that the selected image file is in a supported format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
The encrypted image is saved as a text file with the .txt extension.
Decrypted images are saved in the decrypted_images directory.
